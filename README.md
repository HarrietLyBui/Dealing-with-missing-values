# Dealing-with-missing-values

Deal with missing values in data set by:
Dropping missing values
Using a global constant: -1
Using the attribute mean

Plot a scatter plot to see the differences between original dataset that does not have missing values and those with missing values already handled. The plot also shows a positive correlation between annual sale of milk and grocery in region 1.
